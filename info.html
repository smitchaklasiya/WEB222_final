			<h2>History of Monopoly</h2>
			<p>Monopoly is a board game that has been popular for over a century. The game is based on the concept of buying, renting, and selling properties and was first published in 1935 by Parker Brothers. However, the history of Monopoly can be traced back to the early 1900s.
			<br><br>
				The game was originally called "The Landlord's Game" and was designed by a woman named Elizabeth Magie in 1903. The Landlord's Game was designed to demonstrate the negative aspects of monopolies and to promote the idea of land value taxation. The game was a hit among Magie's friends and family, and she patented the game in 1904.
			<br><br>
				The game was later picked up by a man named Charles Darrow, who made a few changes to the game and began selling it under the name Monopoly. Darrow claimed to have invented the game himself and began selling it to Parker Brothers in 1935. Parker Brothers bought the rights to the game and began marketing it to the public.
			<br><br>
				Monopoly quickly became a popular game, and Parker Brothers began selling different versions of the game with different themes and variations. Today, Monopoly is one of the most popular board games in the world, with millions of copies sold in multiple languages. The game has been adapted into various media, including television shows, video games, and movies.</p>

			<h2>Rules of Monopoly</h2>
			<p>The rules of Monopoly are simple. Each player starts with a set amount of money and a game piece. The game is played by rolling dice and moving around the board. When a player lands on a property, they have the option to buy it. If they do not buy it, the property goes up for auction. The goal of the game is to collect rent from other players and become the wealthiest player. The game ends when one player owns all the properties or when all the players except one are bankrupt.</p>
