			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Monopoly is a classic board game that has been enjoyed by players for over 85 years. The objective of the game is to become the wealthiest player by buying, renting, and trading properties on the game board. Each player begins with a set amount of money and takes turns rolling a pair of dice to move around the board. When a player lands on an unowned property, they have the opportunity to buy it. Once a player owns a property, they can build houses and hotels on it to increase the rent value. The game also includes chance and community chest cards that can provide benefits or drawbacks to players. The game continues until only one player remains, the winner, who has accumulated the most wealth.</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p> Monopoly is a classic board game that has been played for over a century. The game is played by two to eight players, and the goal is to become the wealthiest player by buying, renting, and selling properties.<br><br>

				Here are the rules of Monopoly:
				<br>
				1.	At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a token and places it on the "GO" square.
				<br>
				2.	Each player is given an equal amount of money, and the Banker holds the title deeds, houses, and hotels.
				<br>
				3.	The first player rolls two dice and moves their token that number of spaces on the board. They then follow the instructions on the space they land on.
				<br>
				4.	If a player lands on an unowned property, they can choose to buy it from the bank. If they do not wish to buy the property, it is auctioned off to the highest bidder.
				<br>
				5.	If a player lands on a property that is already owned, they must pay rent to the owner. The amount of rent depends on the value of the property and the number of houses and hotels on it.
				<br>
				6.	If a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw a card and follow the instructions on it.
				<br>
				7.	If a player lands on Income Tax or Luxury Tax, they must pay the amount indicated on the space.
				<br>
				8.	If a player lands on "Go to Jail," they must go directly to Jail without passing Go and without collecting $200.
				<br>
				9.	If a player lands on Free Parking, they do not receive any money.
				<br>
				10.	If a player lands on Go, they collect $200 from the Bank.
				<br>
				11.	If a player owns all the properties of a certain color group, they can begin to build houses and hotels on those properties. This increases the rent that must be paid by other players who land on those spaces.
				<br>
				12. The game continues until one player has driven all other players into bankruptcy by owning all the properties and collecting rent, or by forcing them to pay more money than they can afford.
				<br><br>
				These are the basic rules of Monopoly, but there are many variations and house rules that players can choose to use to make the game more interesting or challenging.s</p>
